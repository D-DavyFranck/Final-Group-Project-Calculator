Introduction to web design class final group  project of a calculator
Introduction to web design (APT 1040C)class final group project of a calculator. This work is a group project of a calculator. It consists of a simple calculator web app with a landing page and a functional calculator. It has basic arithmetic operations mainly addition, substraction, multiplication and division and the three trigonometric functions(Sine, Cosine, tangent). For enhanced accessibility, clear font size and neutral colors have been used. The calculator is also equipped with a voice recognition feature for simple operations to make it more efficient and simpler to use. It is equipped with a unit converter beyond calcuting capabilities. You can find hereafter the comprehensive Instructions related to the project: Objective: Build a fully functional calculator. Key Features: Standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Clear and delete buttons. Responsive design for mobile and desktop. Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for calculations).

MODE OF OPERATION
The calculator has mainly two sections which are a landing page which loads and opens the second section(calculator)
To perform a calculation you click on the number and the nature of operation you want to do and add another number
for example if you want to perform an arithmetic operation: 1+1(then click the '='sign) or 4662*16656 (then click '='sign) 
The Del Button helps you to delete a number 
The AC button clears the input field
For enhanced visibility, once you hover on a button the color changes and the cursor sets to pointer to indicate that you are about to select the button in question
When you calculate using brackets, the operation in brackets has the priority eg: (3+5)*6 will give you 8*6 which 48
The brackets can act as a multiplication sign eg: you can write 8(2) instead of 8*2 to give you 16
for trigonometric operation, first input the number then declare the trigonometric function you want to use eg: 78 tan instead of tan78 
The default mode is the degree mode
you can switch bewteen the degree and radian mode but when you reload the calculator, it sets back to degree mode
The calculator is equipped with  memory recall functions 'MS', 'MR', 'MC', 'M+', 'M-'
MS stored value in the memory. If you click on a number and then press MS that number will be stored in the memory.'MR' will be used to recall that number.

The M+ button can be handy for figuring out complicated expressions if you don't happen to have a scientific calculator. For example, to calculate (5 x 6) + (12 x 2) + (3 x 7), you can do the following:

5 x 6 = (calculator says 30)
MS (stores 30 in memory)
12 x 2 = (calculator says 24)
M+ (takes 24, adds it to 30, stores result 54 in memory)
3 x 7 = (21)
M+ (takes 54, adds 21, stores the result 75)
MR (displays the result 75)
The conversion feature converts a number into different units. First enter the number and select which unit it is in and to what unit you want to convert it to.
For the speech recognition, make sure your browser supports speech recognition and make sure your computer has a working microphone. The browser will prompt you a message to allow it access your microphone which will start recording. When recording prompt a linear operation eg:(nine times eight plus three hundred seventy two, etc)
Don't use the trigonometric functions for the speech recogniton because it may right for example cosine on the screen which is not a supported input
